# Flower Classification using CNN

## Description
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for classifying flower images into five categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and it utilizes image augmentation techniques to improve accuracy. The model achieves flower classification by predicting the type of flower from an input image.

## Features
- Image classification using CNN.
- Data augmentation for improved accuracy.
- Handles five different flower categories.
- Saves the trained model for later use.
- Predicts flower categories for new input images.

## Dataset
You can download the dataset used for this project from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition?rvi=1). Make sure to place the dataset in an appropriate directory structure.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arshad-khan05/Flower-classification-using-CNN.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd Flower-classification-using-CNN
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the repository directory.

5. Ensure you have the Python file named `OutputFlowers.ipynb`.

6. Open and run the `OutputFlowers.ipynb` file in your preferred environment. We recommend using Google Colab for smooth execution.

## Usage
- Make sure to adjust file paths and directory structures according to your setup.
- Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter notebook file for training the model and making predictions.
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Model File
After training, the model will be saved as `OutputFlower.h5`.
